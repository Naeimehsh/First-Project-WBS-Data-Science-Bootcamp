# This is the first project in WBS data science bootcamp.

## Abstract

Eniac is an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories. It was founded in 2008 in Spain and it has since grown and expanded to other neighboring countries. Since the company went public, the investors have been pushing the company to scale up the business and become a big e-commerce player globally. Eniac is exploring an expansion to the Brazilian market. Data shows that Brazil has an eCommerce revenue similar to that of Spain and Italy: an already huge market with an even bigger potential for growth. The problem for Eniac is the lack of knowledge of such a market. The company doesn’t have ties with local providers, package delivery services, or customer service agencies. Here comes Magist. Magist is a Brazilian Software as a Service company that offers a centralized order management system to connect small and medium-sized stores with the biggest Brazilian marketplaces. Magist has allowed Eniac to access a snapshot of their database. Here, we explore Magist’s database to answer Eniac’s concern about whether to expand to the Brazilian Market with Magist, e.g., is Magist a good fit for high-end tech products? Are orders delivered on time?


This project includes following folders:

Magist's database was provided by the WBS coding school as a sql dump file. The database was explored in mySQL workbench, the data was visualized in Tableau Public and then presented via Google Slides in collaboration with Louise Daedlow .
