## Data-Driven Businesses with SQL & Tableau



## Abstract

Eniac is an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories. It was founded in 2008 in Spain and it has since grown and expanded to other neighboring countries. Since the company went public, the investors have been pushing the company to scale up the business and become a big e-commerce player globally. Eniac is exploring an expansion to the Brazilian market. The problem for Eniac is the lack of knowledge of Brazilian market. Here comes Magist. Magist is a Brazilian Software as a Service company that offers a centralized order management system to connect small and medium-sized stores with the biggest Brazilian marketplaces. Magist has allowed Eniac to access a snapshot of their database. In this project, we explore Magist’s database to answer Eniac’s concern about whether to expand to the Brazilian Market with Magist, e.g., is Magist a good fit for high-end tech products? Are orders delivered on time?
